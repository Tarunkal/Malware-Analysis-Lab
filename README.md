# Malware-Analysis-Lab

## Objective

To demonstrate the creation of a comprehensive cybersecurity home lab utilizing VMware technology to execute over 20 malware experiments, aimed at enhancing malware detection and analysis capabilities. This project involves the thorough analysis of system events, which led to the identification of 100+ malware variants. The insights gained were applied to optimize countermeasures and strengthen the security protocols designed for improved threat defense. The goal is to showcase advanced skills in malware analysis, virtual lab environment configuration, and the development of effective security strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Proficient in setting up and configuring virtual environments using VMware for cybersecurity testing.
- Advanced skills in malware analysis and reverse engineering of 20+ malware samples.
- Ability to conduct thorough event analysis, identifying 100+ malware variants and behavioral patterns.
- Expertise in optimizing security protocols and countermeasures based on experimental findings.
- Enhanced critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in identifying and mitigating malware threats.
  
### Tools Used


- VMware for creating and managing isolated virtual environments for malware testing.
- PE Studio for static malware analysis and identifying malicious indicators.
- Procmon for real-time event monitoring and behavioral analysis of malware.
- Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic generated by malware.
- Sysmon for advanced event logging and tracking of malware activities in the virtual environment.
